# Photon Sprite Movement State Machine

## What is the Photon Sprite?

This project coordinates the movement of the **Photon Sprite**, a virtual reality character that will be integrated into the [UW Virtual Brain Project](https://schlosslab.discovery.wisc.edu/projects/), a research project in the [Schloss Visual Reasoning Lab](https://github.com/SchlossVRL) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Photon Sprite's goal is to guide users, especially youth and children, through a virtual environment and call attention to important features in the environment.


Here it is in action (you will need to download it to view for now):

## What is a state machine?
A **state machine** is a collection of code that coordinates an object by transitioning it through a series of states. In this case, the states correspond to different ways the sprite can move (e.g. flying towards a target or hovering above the user's hand). In ![this video](ColorChangeDemo.mp4), each color represents a different state. 


## Here's a reflection on my summer work from fall 2020:

## Thank you!
I'm grateful for the mentorship from [Simon Smith](https://github.com/spsmith) and [Ross Tredinnick](https://github.com/rossTnick), and my collaboration with [Kudirat Alimi](https://github.com/kudirat), who developed the particle effects for the Photon Sprite. My summer research was made possible by the [Women in Science and Engineering learning community](https://www.housing.wisc.edu/residence-halls/learning-communities/wise/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 


Here were some of the tutorials I used to build this project:
* [The State Design Pattern](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/state.html)
* Infallible Code's tutorials on [State Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1bd75R10m4) and [Finite State Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PTd0WdKB-4)
